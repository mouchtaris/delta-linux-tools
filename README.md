Delta-Linux

This is the toolchain that is used to build the [Delta language](http://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html) in linux systems.

This project does not create a complete port of windows generated tools and file layout in Linux. Instead, it attempts to offer a UNIX/Linux philosophy toolchain for the Delta language.

The tools included in this project, the source code modifications required and the custom tool source code are all written and maintained by Nikos Mouchtaris <mouchtaris@gmail.com>.
